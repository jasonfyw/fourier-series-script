# fourier-series

**Using rotating vectors in complex space connected end-to-end to replicate user-input drawings.**

This is achieved through approximating the Fourier series extended into the complex plane. It's not as exciting to use an SVG or something as an input function so the initial function is inputted by the user drawing on the canvas with their mouse pointer. 

This program is based on [3Blue1Brown's amazing video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k) showcasing and explaining Fourier transforms and series.


## Usage

After cloning, run the program by executing the following command in the repo's directory

```
$ python3 fourier_animation.py
```
